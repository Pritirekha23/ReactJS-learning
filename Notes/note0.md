- Components allow for creating and reusing designs without repetition
- Each element, such as the logo and sub-menus , navbar,footer, is considered a component.
- React applications are built with a tree of components
- React elements can be considered as a virtual DOM tree, with reconciliation and diffing algorithms.
- In React, reusing components saves time by reducing the need to rewrite the same code for similar elements.
- React's declarative nature focuses on defining the end result of the user interface, making the code easier to read and maintain.
